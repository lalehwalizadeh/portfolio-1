                This game works in such a way that you have to guess the number hidden in the question mark box.
                In the box on the left, you can enter a number and press the check button to see the result.
                If your number is greater than the hidden number, you will see this text on the right side (high),
                and if your number is small, this text will be displayed for you. will be (low).
                This way you can guess more easily. And if you enter the correct number, you will win and you will
                see some changes such as changing the background color and revealing the hidden number.
